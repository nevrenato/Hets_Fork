Hets is the main analysis tool for the specification
language heterogeneous CASL. Heterogeneous CASL (HetCASL, see
<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agbkb/forschung/formal_methods/CoFI/HetCASL/index_e.htm>) combines
the specification language CASL with CASL extensions and
sublanguages, as well as completely different logics and even
programming languages such as Haskell, including its module system.
Hets provides parsing, static analysis and proof management
(via development graphs), as well as many other functionalities.
Hets is written in Haskell (see <http://www.haskell.org> and
<http://trac.informatik.uni-bremen.de:8080/hets/wiki/HetsForDevelopers>)

The general background of Hets is explained in /Heterogeneous
specification and the heterogeneous tool set/
(<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~till/papers/habil.ps>).
A short introduction is given in
<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~till/papers/hets-tacas.pdf>.

The Hets modules are grouped using hierarchical modules (where modules
can be grouped into folders); we here only discuss the top view on
this hierarchy. For a more details, look at the descriptions of
the folders or the individual modules.

The folder "Logic" contains the infrastructure needed for presenting a
logic to Hets.  This is complemented by folders working at the
heterogeneous level --- the code in modules in these folders is
parameterized over an arbitrary but fixed logic graph.  Existential
types are used for implementing the heterogeneity, see
<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Existential_type>.  The folder /Syntax/
(see "Syntax.ADoc") provides abstract syntax and parsing of
heterogeneous structured specifications. "Static" is for the static
analysis, based on the verification static semantics for Heterogeneous
CASL.  "Static.DevGraph" contains the data structures for
heterogeneous development graphs, including proof management.
Finally, the folder "Proofs"
contains an implementation of the proof calculus for heterogeneous
development graphs.


The folders "CASL", "CoCASL", "HasCASL",
"Haskell", "CspCASL", "Modal", "Isabelle"
contain different instances of the type class 'Logic.Logic.Logic' of the
module "Logic.Logic".  These instances always are contained in
a module named /Logic_xxx/, where /xxx/ is the name of
the language at hand.  Since the integration of a new logic into Hets
requires writing a new instantiation of the type class 'Logic.Logic.Logic',
it is advisable to consult the module /Logic_xxx/ (and the modules
imported there) for some logic that is in some sense similar to the new
logic to be integrated.
In particular, we have
implemented the CASL logic in such a way that much of the folder
"CASL" can be re-used for CASL extensions as well; this is
achieved via /holes/ (realized via polymorphic variables) in the
types for signatures, morphisms, abstract syntax etc.  This eases
integration of CASL extensions and keeps the effort quite moderate.

The folder "Comorphisms" contains various comorphisms and other
translations that constitute the logic graph. Note that these modules
can be compiled independently of the logic independent heterogeneous
modules listed above. The module "Comorphisms.LogicList"
assembles all the logics into one (heterogeneous) list, while
"Comorphisms.LogicGraph" builds up the logic graph,
i.e. it assembles all the (co)morphisms among the logics,
and also specifies which ones are standard inclusions.
This module also provides a partial union for logics, which is
crucial for the static analysis of unions of specifications
(which may occur explicitly or implicitly).

Last but not least, there are general purpose folders.  The most
important one is the folder "Common". It contains general purpose
libraries, e.g. for relations, and for parsing and
pretty printing. "Common.Result" provides a monad for error handling
and error messages that is used at many places throughout Hets.

The folder "ATC" is for conversion from and to shared ATerms
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aterm>. The /utils/ folder contains tools
like /DriFT/.

The command line interface is contained in "Driver", the graphical
interface in "GUI". The latter is based on the UniForM Workbench
that provides an event system and encapsulations of TclTk
<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/htk/> and uDraw(Graph)
<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph/en/index.html>,
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uni-uDrawGraph>.

Hets is also based on the following third-party libraries:

 * expat for fast XML parsing, see
   <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hexpat>

 * The combinator parser library Parsec, see
   <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec>,
   <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec1>
   and "Propositional.Parse_AS_Basic" for a sample use

 * finite sets and maps, see
   <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers>

 * finite graphs from the functional graph library (fgl), see
   <http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/fgl/haskell/>
   and <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl>

 * the xml light package, see
   <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml>
