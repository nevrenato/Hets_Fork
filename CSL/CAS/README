This directory contains libraries for computer algebra systems
connected to Hets. The functions provided in the libraries cover the
functions which are neccessary for the Hets EnCL CAS interface.
For each CAS you can find the function mapping in the corresponding
Interpreter code file (e.g., MathematicaInterpreter.hs).
