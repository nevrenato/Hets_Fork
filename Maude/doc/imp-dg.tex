We describe in this section the main functions used to draw the
development graph for Maude specifications. The most important function is
\verb"anaMaudeFile", that receives a record of all the options received
from the command line (of type \verb"HetcatsOpts") and the path of
the Maude file to be parsed and returns a pair with the library
name and its environment. This environment contains two development
graphs, the first one containing the modules used in the Maude prelude
and another one with the user specification:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
anaMaudeFile :: HetcatsOpts -> FilePath -> IO (Maybe (LibName, LibEnv))
anaMaudeFile _ file = do
    (dg1, dg2) <- directMaudeParsing file
    let ln = emptyLibName file
        lib1 = Map.singleton preludeLib $
                 computeDGraphTheories Map.empty $ markFree Map.empty $
                 markHiding Map.empty dg1
        lib2 = Map.insert ln
                 (computeDGraphTheories lib1 $ markFree lib1 $
                 markHiding lib1 dg2) lib1
    return $ Just (ln, lib2)
\end{verbatim}
}

This environment is computed with the function \verb"directMaudeParsing", that
receives the path introduced by the user and returns a pair of development graphs.
These graphs are obtained with the function \verb"maude2DG", that receives
the predefined specifications (obtained with \verb"predefinedSpecs")
and the user defined specifications (obtained with \verb"traverseSpecs"):

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
directMaudeParsing :: FilePath -> IO (DGraph, DGraph)
directMaudeParsing fp = do
  ml <- getEnvDef "MAUDE_LIB" ""
  if null ml then error "environment variable MAUDE_LIB is not set" else do
    ns <- parse fp
    let ns' = either (const []) id ns
    (hIn, hOut, hErr, procH) <- runMaude
    exitCode <- getProcessExitCode procH
    case exitCode of
      Nothing -> do
              hPutStrLn hIn $ "load " ++ fp
              hFlush hIn
              hPutStrLn hIn "."
              hFlush hIn
              hPutStrLn hIn "in Maude/hets.prj"
              psps <- predefinedSpecs hIn hOut
              sps <- traverseSpecs hIn hOut ns'
              (ok, errs) <- getErrors hErr
              if ok
                  then do
                        hClose hIn
                        hClose hOut
                        hClose hErr
                        return $ maude2DG psps sps
                  else do
                        hClose hIn
                        hClose hOut
                        hClose hErr
                        error errs
      Just ExitSuccess -> error "maude terminated immediately"
      Just (ExitFailure i) -> error $ "calling maude failed with exitCode: " ++ show i
\end{verbatim}
}

The function \verb"maude2DG" first computes the data structures associated to the
predefined specifications and then uses them to compute the development
graph related to the specifications introduced by the user. These
data structures are computed with \verb"insertSpecs":

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
maude2DG :: [Spec] -> [Spec] -> (DGraph, DGraph)
maude2DG psps sps = (dg1, dg2)
   where (_, tim, vm, tks, dg1) = insertSpecs psps emptyDG Map.empty 
                                              Map.empty Map.empty [] emptyDG
         (_,_, _, _, dg2) = insertSpecs sps dg1 tim Map.empty vm tks emptyDG
\end{verbatim}
}


Before describing this function,
we briefly explain the data structures used during the generation of
the development graph:

\begin{itemize}

\item The type \verb"ParamSort" defines a pair with a symbol representing
a sort and a list of tokens indicating the parameters present in the sort,
so for example the sort \verb"List{X, Y}" generates the pair
\verb"(List{X, Y}, [X,Y])":

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type ParamSort = (Symbol, [Token])
\end{verbatim}
}

\item The information of each node introduced
in the development graph is stored in the tuple \verb"ProcInfo", that
contains the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item The identifier of the node.
\item The signature of the node.
\item A list of symbols standing for the sorts that are not instantiated.
\item A list of triples with information about the parameters of the
specification, namely the name of the parameter, the name of the theory,
and the list of not instantiated sorts from this theory.
\item A list with information about the parameterized sorts.
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type ProcInfo = (Node, Sign, Symbols, [(Token, Token, Symbols)], [ParamSort])
\end{verbatim}
}

\item Each \verb"ProcInfo" tuple is associated to its corresponding module
expression in the \verb"TokenInfoMap" map:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type TokenInfoMap = Map.Map Token ProcInfo
\end{verbatim}
}

\item When a module expression is parsed a \verb"ModExpProc" tuple is
returned, containing the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item The identifier of the module expression.
\item The \verb"TokenInfoMap" structure updated with the data
in the module expression.
\item The morphism associated to the module expression.
\item The list of sorts parameterized in this module expression.
\item The development graph thus far.
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type ModExpProc = (Token, TokenInfoMap, Morphism, [ParamSort], DGraph)
\end{verbatim}
}

\item When parsing a list of importation statements we return a
\verb"ParamInfo" tuple, containing:

\begin{itemize}
\item The list of parameter information: the name of the parameter,
the name of the theory, and the sorts that are not instantiated.
\item The updated \verb"TokenInfoMap" map.
\item The list of morphisms associated with each parameter.
\item The updated development graph.
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type ParamInfo = ([(Token, Token, Symbols)], TokenInfoMap, [Morphism], DGraph)
\end{verbatim}
}

\item Data about views is kept in a separated way from data about theories
and modules. The \verb"ViewMap" map associates to each view identifier a
tuple with:

\begin{itemize}
\item The identifier of the target node of the view.
\item The morphism generated by the view.
\item The list of renamings that generated the morphism.
\item A Boolean value indicating whether the target is a theory
(\verb"True") or a module (\verb"False").
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type ViewMap = Map.Map Token (Node, Token, Morphism, [Renaming], Bool)
\end{verbatim}
}

\item Finally, we describe the tuple \verb"InsSpecRes",
used to return the data structures
updated when a specification or a view is introduced in the development
graph. It contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two values of type \verb"TokenInfoMap". The first one includes all
the information related to the specification, including the one from the
predefined modules, while the
second one only contains information related to the current development
graph.
\item The updated \verb"ViewMap".
\item A list of tokens indicating the theories introduced thus far.
\item The new development graph.
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
type InsSpecRes = (TokenInfoMap, TokenInfoMap, ViewMap, [Token], DGraph)
\end{verbatim}
}

\end{itemize}

The function \verb"insertSpecs" traverses the specifications updating the
data structures and the development graph with \verb"insertSpec":

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertSpecs :: [Spec] -> DGraph -> TokenInfoMap -> TokenInfoMap -> ViewMap -> [Token] -> DGraph
               -> InsSpecRes
insertSpecs [] _ ptim tim vm tks dg = (ptim, tim, vm, tks, dg)
insertSpecs (s : ss) pdg ptim tim vm ths dg = insertSpecs ss pdg ptim' tim' vm' ths' dg'
              where (ptim', tim', vm', ths', dg') = insertSpec s pdg ptim tim vm ths dg
\end{verbatim}
}

The behavior of \verb"insertSpec" is different for each type of Maude
specification. When the introduced specification is a module, the
following actions are performed:

\begin{itemize}
\item The parameters are parsed:

\begin{itemize}
\item The list of parameter declarations is obtained with the auxiliary
function \verb"getParams".
\item These declarations are processed with \verb"processParameters",
that returns a tuple of type \verb"ParamInfo" shown above.
\item Given the parameters names, we traverse the list of sorts to check
whether the module defines parameterized sorts with \verb"getSortsParameterizedBy".
\item The links between the theories in the parameters and the current module
are created with \verb"createEdgesParams".
\end{itemize}

\item The importations are handled:

\begin{itemize}
\item The importation statements are obtained with \verb"getImportsSorts".
Although this function also returns the sorts declared in the module, in
this case they are not needed and its value is ignored.
\item These importations are handled by \verb"processImports", that
returns a list containing the information of each parameter.
\item The definition links generated by the imports are created with
\verb"createEdgesImports".
\end{itemize}

\item The final signature is obtained with \verb"sign_union_morphs"
by merging the signature in the current module with the ones obtained
from the morphisms from the parameters and the imports.

\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertSpec :: Spec -> DGraph -> TokenInfoMap -> TokenInfoMap -> ViewMap -> [Token] -> DGraph
              -> InsSpecRes
insertSpec (SpecMod sp_mod) pdg ptim tim vm ths dg = (ptimUp, tim5, vm, ths, dg6)
      where ps = getParams sp_mod
            (il, _) = getImportsSorts sp_mod
            up = incPredImps il pdg (ptim, tim, dg)
            (ptimUp, timUp, dgUp) = incPredParams ps pdg up
            (pl, tim1, morphs, dg1) = processParameters ps timUp dgUp
            top_sg = Maude.Sign.fromSpec sp_mod
            paramSorts = getSortsParameterizedBy (paramNames ps) (Set.toList $ sorts top_sg
            ips = processImports tim1 vm dg1 il
            (tim2, dg2) = last_da ips (tim1, dg1)
            sg = sign_union_morphs morphs $ sign_union top_sg ips
            ext_sg = makeExtSign Maude sg
            nm_sns = map (makeNamed "") $ Maude.Sentence.fromSpec sp_mod
            sens = toThSens nm_sns
            gt = G_theory Maude ext_sg startSigId sens startThId
            tok = HasName.getName sp_mod
            name = makeName tok
            (ns, dg3) = insGTheory dg2 name DGBasic gt
            tim3 = Map.insert tok (getNode ns, sg, [], pl, paramSorts) tim2
            (tim4, dg4) = createEdgesImports tok ips sg tim3 dg3
            dg5 = createEdgesParams tok pl morphs sg tim4 dg4
            (_, tim5, dg6) = insertFreeNode tok tim4 morphs dg5
\end{verbatim}
}

When the specification inserted is a theory the process varies slightly:

\begin{itemize}
\item Theories cannot be parameterized in Core Maude, so the parameter
handling is not required.
\item The specified sorts have to be qualified with the parameter
name when used in a parameterized module. These sorts are extracted
with \verb"getImportsSorts" and kept in the corresponding field of
\verb"TokenInfoMap".
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertSpec (SpecTh sp_th) pdg ptim tim vm ths dg = (ptimUp, tim3, vm, tok : ths, dg3)
      where (il, ss1) = getImportsSorts sp_th
            (ptimUp, timUp, dgUp) = incPredImps il pdg (ptim, tim, dg)
            ips = processImports timUp vm dgUp il
            ss2 = getThSorts ips
            (tim1, dg1) = last_da ips (tim, dg)
            sg = sign_union (Maude.Sign.fromSpec sp_th) ips
            ext_sg = makeExtSign Maude sg
            nm_sns = map (makeNamed "") $ Maude.Sentence.fromSpec sp_th
            sens = toThSens nm_sns
            gt = G_theory Maude ext_sg startSigId sens startThId
            tok = HasName.getName sp_th
            name = makeName tok
            (ns, dg2) = insGTheory dg1 name DGBasic gt
            tim2 = Map.insert tok (getNode ns, sg, ss1 ++ ss2, [], []) tim1
            (tim3, dg3) = createEdgesImports tok ips sg tim2 dg2
\end{verbatim}
}

The introduction of views into the development graph follows these steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item The function \verb"isInstantiated" checks whether the target of the
view is a theory or a module. This value will be used to decide whether the
sorts have to be qualified when this is view is used.
\item A morphism is generated between the signatures of the source and
target specifications.
\item If there is a renaming between terms the function \verb"sign4renamings"
generates the extra signature and sentences needed. These values, kept in
\verb"new_sign" and \verb"new_sens" are used to create an inner node with
the function \verb"insertInnerNode".
\item Finally, a theorem link stating the proof obligations generated by
the view is introduced between the source and the target of the view with
\verb"insertThmEdgeMorphism".
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertSpec (SpecView sp_v) pdg ptim tim vm ths dg = (ptimUp, tim3, vm', ths, dg4)
      where View name from to rnms = sp_v
            (ptimUp, timUp, dgUp) = incPredView from to pdg (ptim, tim, dg)
            inst = isInstantiated ths to
            tok_name = HasName.getName name
            (tok1, tim1, morph1, _, dg1) = processModExp timUp vm dgUp from
            (tok2, tim2, morph2, _, dg2) = processModExp tim1 vm dg1 to
            (n1, _, _, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok1 tim2
            (n2, _, _, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok2 tim2
            morph = fromSignsRenamings (target morph1) (target morph2) rnms
            morph' = fromJust $ maybeResult $ compose morph1 morph
            (new_sign, new_sens) = sign4renamings (target morph1) (sortMap morph) rnms
            (n3, tim3, dg3) = insertInnerNode n2 tim2 tok2 morph2 new_sign new_sens dg2
            vm' = Map.insert (HasName.getName name) (n3, tok2, morph', rnms, inst) vm
            dg4 = insertThmEdgeMorphism tok_name n3 n1 morph' dg3
\end{verbatim}
}

We describe now the main auxiliary functions used above.
Module expressions are parsed following the guidelines outlined in
Section \ref{subsec:me}:

\begin{itemize}
\item When the module expression is a simple identifier its signature
and its parameterized sorts are extracted from the \verb"TokenInfoMap"
and returned, while the generated morphism is an inclusion:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
processModExp :: TokenInfoMap -> ViewMap -> DGraph -> ModExp -> ModExpProc
processModExp tim _ dg (ModExp modId) = (tok, tim, morph, ps, dg)
                     where tok = HasName.getName modId
                           (_, sg, _, _, ps) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok tim
                           morph = Maude.Morphism.inclusion sg sg
\end{verbatim}
}

\item The parsing of the summation expression performs the following
steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item The information about the module expressions is recursively
computed with \verb"processModExp".
\item The signature of the resulting module expression is obtained
with the \verb"union" of signatures.
\item The morphism generated by the summation is just an inclusion.
\item A new node for the summation is introduced with \verb"insertNode".
\item The target signature of the obtained morphisms is substituted
by this new signature with \verb"setTarget".
\item These new morphisms are used to generate the links between the
summation and its summands in \verb"insertDefEdgeMorphism".
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
processModExp tim vm dg (SummationModExp modExp1 modExp2) = (tok, tim3, morph, ps', dg5)
          where (tok1, tim1, morph1, ps1, dg1) = processModExp tim vm dg modExp1
                (tok2, tim2, morph2, ps2, dg2) = processModExp tim1 vm dg1 modExp2
                ps' = deleteRepeated $ ps1 ++ ps2
                tok = mkSimpleId $ concat ["{", show tok1, " + ", show tok2, "}"]
                (n1, _, ss1, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok1 tim2
                (n2, _, ss2, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok2 tim2
                ss1' = translateSorts morph1 ss1
                ss2' = translateSorts morph1 ss2
                sg1 = target morph1
                sg2 = target morph2
                sg = Maude.Sign.union sg1 sg2
                morph = Maude.Morphism.inclusion sg sg
                morph1' = setTarget sg morph1
                morph2' = setTarget sg morph2
                (tim3, dg3) = insertNode tok sg tim2 (ss1' ++ ss2') [] dg2
                (n3, _, _, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok tim3
                dg4 = insertDefEdgeMorphism n3 n1 morph1' dg3
                dg5 = insertDefEdgeMorphism n3 n2 morph2' dg4
\end{verbatim}
}

\item The renaming module expression recursively parses the inner expression, computes the morphism from the given renamings with \verb"fromSignRenamings",
taking special care of the renaming of the parameterized sorts with
\verb"applyRenamingParamSorts". Once the values are computed, the final morphism
is obtained from the composition of the morphisms computed for the inner
expression and the one computed from the renamings:


{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
processModExp tim vm dg (RenamingModExp modExp rnms) = (tok, tim', comp_morph, ps', dg')
              where (tok, tim', morph, ps, dg') = processModExp tim vm dg modExp
                    morph' = fromSignRenamings (target morph) rnms
                    ps' = applyRenamingParamSorts (sortMap morph') ps
                    comp_morph = fromJust $ maybeResult $ compose morph morph'
\end{verbatim}
}

\item The parsing of the instantiation module expression works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The information of the instantiated parameterized module is obtained
with \verb"processModExp".
\item The parameter names are obtained by applying \verb"fstTpl", that
extracts the first component of a triple, to the information about the
parameters of the parameterized module.
\item Parameterized sorts are instantiated with \verb"instantiateSorts",
that returns the new parameterized sorts, in case the target of the view
is a theory, and the morphism associated.
\item The view identifiers are processed with \verb"processViews". This
function returns the token identifying the list of views, the morphism
to be applied from the parameterized module, a list of pairs of nodes
and morphisms, indicating the morphism that has to be used in the link
from each view, and a list with the updated information about the
parameters due to the views with theories as target.
\item The morphism returned is the inclusion morphism.
\item The links between the targets of the views and the expression
are created with \verb"updateGraphViews". 
\end{itemize}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
processModExp tim vm dg (InstantiationModExp modExp views) = 
                                        (tok'', tim'', final_morph, new_param_sorts, dg'')
       where (tok, tim', morph, paramSorts, dg') = processModExp tim vm dg modExp
             (_, _, _, ps, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok tim'
             param_names = map fstTpl ps
             view_names = map HasName.getName views
             (new_param_sorts, ps_morph) = instantiateSorts param_names 
                                                            view_names vm morph paramSorts
             (tok', morph1, ns, deps) = processViews views (mkSimpleId "") tim' 
                                                     vm ps (ps_morph, [], [])
             tok'' = mkSimpleId $ concat [show tok, "{", show tok', "}"]
             sg2 = target morph1
             final_morph = Maude.Morphism.inclusion sg2 sg2
             (tim'', dg'') = if Map.member tok'' tim
                             then (tim', dg')
                             else updateGraphViews tok tok'' sg2 morph1 ns tim' deps dg'
\end{verbatim}
}

\end{itemize}

We present the function \verb"insertNode" to describe how the nodes are
introduced into the development graph. This function receives the
identifier of the node, its signature,\footnote{Note that when the
function \texttt{insertNode} is used there are not sentences.}
the \verb"TokenInfoMap" map, a list of sorts, and information
about the parameters and returns the updated map and the new development
graph. First, it checks whether
the node is already in the development graph. If it is in the graph,
the current map and graph are returned. In other case, the extended
signature is computed with \verb"makeExtSign" and used to create a graph
theory that will be inserted with \verb"insGTheory", obtaining the new
node information and the new development graph. Finally, the map is
updated with the information received as parameter and the node identifier
obtained when the node was introduced:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertNode :: Token -> Sign -> TokenInfoMap -> Symbols -> [(Token, Token, Symbols)]
              -> DGraph -> (TokenInfoMap, DGraph)
insertNode tok sg tim ss deps dg = if Map.member tok tim
                     then (tim, dg)
                     else let
                            ext_sg = makeExtSign Maude sg
                            gt = G_theory Maude ext_sg startSigId noSens startThId
                            name = makeName tok
                            (ns, dg') = insGTheory dg name DGBasic gt
                            tim' = Map.insert tok (getNode ns, sg, ss, deps, []) tim
                          in (tim', dg')
\end{verbatim}
}

The function \verb"insertDefEdgeMorphism" describes how the definition links
are introduced into the
development graph. It receives the identifier of the source and target
nodes, the morphism to be used in the link, and the current development
graph. The morphism is transformed into a development graph morphism
indicating the current logic (\verb"Maude") and the type (\verb"globalDef")
and is introduced in the development graph with \verb"insLEdgeDG":

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertDefEdgeMorphism :: Node -> Node -> Morphism -> DGraph -> DGraph
insertDefEdgeMorphism n1 n2 morph dg = snd $ insLEdgeDG (n2, n1, edg) dg
                     where mor = G_morphism Maude morph startMorId
                           edg = globDefLink (gEmbed mor) SeeTarget
\end{verbatim}
}

Theorem links are introduced with \verb"insertThmEdgeMorphism"
in the same way, but specifying with
\verb"globalThm" that the link is a theorem link. This function receives
as extra argument the name of the view generating the proof obligations,
that is used to name the link:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertThmEdgeMorphism :: Token -> Node -> Node -> Morphism -> DGraph -> DGraph
insertThmEdgeMorphism name n1 n2 morph dg = snd $ insLEdgeDG (n2, n1, edg) dg
                     where mor = G_morphism Maude morph startMorId
                           edg = defDGLink (gEmbed mor) globalThm
                                 (DGLinkView name $ Fitted [])
\end{verbatim}
}

The function \verb"insertFreeEdge" receives the names of the nodes and
the \verb"TokenInfoMap" and builds an inclusion morphism to use it in
the \verb"FreeOrCofreeDefLink" link:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
insertFreeEdge :: Token -> Token -> TokenInfoMap -> DGraph -> DGraph
insertFreeEdge tok1 tok2 tim dg = snd $ insLEdgeDG (n2, n1, edg) dg
          where (n1, _, _, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok1 tim
                (n2, sg2, _, _, _) = fromJust $ Map.lookup tok2 tim
                mor = G_morphism Maude (Maude.Morphism.inclusion Maude.Sign.empty sg2) startMorId
                dgt = FreeOrCofreeDefLink NPFree $ EmptyNode (Logic Maude)
                edg = defDGLink (gEmbed mor) dgt SeeTarget
\end{verbatim}
}
