If something does not work as above, you probably did not set up the
Simplifier Rules correctly or forgot the "local simplifier equations"
Control Heuristic (h-step).

It may be a good idea to replay every single proof first, before attempting
the next one. (Only replayed proofs are reported back to hets.)

Locked lemmas are not properly written back and the proofs will be lost by
unlocking.

In case of a crash you'll have to kill the remaining lisp and wish processes
manually from within another shell.

Do not check in a changed file Imports_List_1.tar!  This archive always
changes when replaying proofs.  A successful replayed proof on any node will
report all proven lemmas back to hets.

Of course you need the secret binary hetsvse in your PATH or pointed to by
the environment variable HETS_VSE.
