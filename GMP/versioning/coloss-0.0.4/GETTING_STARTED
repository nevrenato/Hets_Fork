Getting started with COLOSS 0.0.4:

(a) Stand-Alone Modal Logics
----------------------------

Run hugs examples.hml.hs (Hennessy-Milner Logic)
or  hugs examples.gml.hs (Graded Modal Logic)
or  hugs examples.coalition.hs (Coalition Logic)
or  hugs examples.pml.hs (Proabilistic Modal Logic)

and try provable and/or satisfiable on the formulas defined in the
respective files.


(b) Combinations of Logics
--------------------------

(i) Run hugs examples.gluings.hs and execute gen (flatten seg)
    This will create a satisfiability solver for the logic
		associated with Segala Systems in the file MySat.hs.
(ii) Leave hugs and run hugs -98 examples.segala.hs and try provable
    and/or satisfiable on the formulas defined there.

CAVEAT: The examples for Segala systems  only work with the
satisfiability solver for Segala systems that can be generated by
running gen (flatten seg) from ``examples.gluings.hs''.
