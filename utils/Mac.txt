The gtk-2.14 framework can be used under Snow Leopard after:
- adding the pkg-config of the framework to the PATH

- cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools

- adding ~/.cabal/bin to the PATH

- add -m32 to gcc

  gcc -m32 $@

- cabal install gtk-0.11.2
  gtk-0.12.0 does not work!
  The gio package is not necessary, but it will be installed
  when installing glade (even if gtk was installed without by:
  cabal install gtk-0.11.2 -f -have-gio).

- cabal install glade-0.11.1

http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg
has pango-1.26.2 that is rejected by pango.cabal.
(Changing pango.cabal seems to work, though.)

gtk+-2.0 and libglade2 from Macports will work, too.
For linking -L/usr/lib should be added to ghc's command line
otherwise the wrong libiconv is used for the base and haskeline package.
(This is not necessary for the ghc from Macports.)

I've mananged to use quartz-gtk as follows:
sudo port uninstall libglade2 gtk2 pango cairo
sudo port install gtk2 +no_x11 +quartz +universal
sudo port install libglade2 +no_x11 +quartz +universal

From the gtk-0.12.0 sources remove "drawableGetID" in
Graphics/UI/Gtk/General/Structs.hsc and Graphics/UI/Gtk/Gdk/Drawable.chs
otherwise the linker reports: Undefined symbols:
  "_gdk_x11_drawable_get_xid", referenced from:
      _s24wg_info in libHSgtk-0.12.0.a(Structs.o)

uDrawGraph and (Aqua-) tcl/tk work without X (and uDrawGraph will not change)
(So hets cannot be called remotely.)

ghc-6.10.4 does not work with the wai-extra cabal package
ghc-6.12.3 does not exist in 64Bit mode
ghc-7.10.1 does not support programatica #884

In order to address a proper emacs for isabelle set:
  export HETS_ISABELLE=\
   'isabelle emacs -p /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs'

The current hets-0.97-installer-intel-mac.jar contains a binary without gtk,
so consistency checks are not supported. Also pellet (and fact) is not
included.
