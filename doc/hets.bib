  abstract = {We develop the semantic foundations of the specification language HasCASL, which combines algebraic specification and functional programming on the basis of Moggi's partial {$\lambda$}-calculus. Generalizing Lambek's classical equivalence between the simply typed {$\lambda$}-calculus and cartesian closed categories, we establish an equivalence between partial cartesian closed categories (pccc's) and partial {$\lambda$}-theories. Building on these results, we define (set-theoretic) notions of intensional Henkin model and syntactic {$\lambda$}-algebra for Moggi's partial {$\lambda$}-calculus. These models are shown to be equivalent to the originally described categorical models in pccc's via the global element construction. The semantics of HasCASL is defined in terms of syntactic {$\lambda$}-algebras. Correlations between logics and classes of categories facilitate reasoning both on the logical and on the categorical side; as an application, we pinpoint unique choice as the distinctive feature of topos logic (in comparison to intuitionistic higher-order logic of partial functions, which by our results is the logic of pccc's with
equality). Finally, we give some applications of the model-theoretic equivalence result to the semantics of HasCASL and its relation to first-order CASL.

  abstract = {Heterogeneous specification becomes more and more important because
complex systems are often specified using multiple viewpoints,
involving multiple formalisms. Moreover, a formal software development
process may lead to a change of formalism during the development.
However, current research in integrated formal methods only deals
with ad-hoc integrations of different formalisms.

The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is a parsing, static analysis and
proof management tool combining various such tools for individual
specification languages, thus providing a tool for heterogeneous
multi-logic specification. Hets is based on a graph of logics and
languages (formalized as so-called institutions), their tools, and
their translations.  This provides a clean semantics of heterogeneous
specification, as well as a corresponding proof calculus. For proof
management, the calculus of development graphs (known from other
large-scale proof management systems) has been adapted to
heterogeneous specification. Development graphs provide an overview of
the (heterogeneous) specification module hierarchy and the current
proof state, and thus may be used for monitoring the overall
correctness of a heterogeneous development.},

  abstract = {Development graphs are a tool for dealing with structured
  specifications in a formal program development in order to ease the
  management of change and reusing proofs. In this work, we extend
  development graphs with hiding (e.g. hidden operations).  Hiding is
  a particularly difficult to realize operation, since it does not
  admit such a good decomposition of the involved specifications as
  other structuring operations do. We develop both a semantics and
  proof rules for development graphs with hiding. The rules are proven
  to be sound, and also complete relative to an oracle for
  conservative extensions. We also show that an absolutely complete set
  of rules cannot exist.

  The whole framework is developed in a way independent of the
  underlying logical system (and thus also does not prescribe the
  nature of the parts of a specification that may be hidden).  We also
  show how various other logic independent specification formalisms
  can be mapped into development graphs; thus, development graphs can
  serve as a kernel formalism for management of proofs and of change.},
