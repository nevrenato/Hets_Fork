  abstract =	"This paper defines a dynamic semantics for the
		 functional programming language Haskell. The semantics
		 defines the meaning of expressions, modules and
		 programs, including all nonoptional I/O requests. All
		 constructs in the Haskell language are considered. We
		 use the same natural semantics style as the definition
		 of Standard ML. For brevity, we assume that the
		 translations specified by the Wadler/Peyton Jones
		 static semantics have been performed, and base our
		 source language on the target language of the static
		 semantics. 1 Introduction This paper defines the
		 dynamic semantics of the full Haskell language [HW90,
		 HJW91, HJW92]. The dynamic semantics is complementary
		 to the existing static semantics for Haskell [JW92] in
		 two respects: firstly it defines the meaning of the
		 second-order polymorphic lambda-calculus which is
		 synthesised by that semantics; secondly it is defined
		 using a natural semantic form, where meaning is
		 expressed through judgement rules. This corresponds to
		 the type infe...",
